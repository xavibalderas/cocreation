#resin.io + python + raspberry pi camera module + flask

This app is based on the sample app given for the [raspberry pi camera module](https://github.com/resin-io-projects/resin-rpi-python-picamera). It uses resin.io for deployment and for public URL access. Thanks to Flask, every time someone visits the device URL, the pi snaps a photo and displays it in the webpage.
