## Tools 
[**PiCamera**](https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.13/) [**Flask**](http://flask.pocoo.org/) [**Resin.io**](https://resin.io/)

## Description
This app is based on the sample app given for the [raspberry pi camera module](https://github.com/resin-io-projects/resin-rpi-python-picamera). It uses resin.io for deployment and for public URL access. With Flask, every time someone visits the device URL, the pi snaps a photo and displays it in the webpage.
